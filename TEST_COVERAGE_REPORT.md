   - Test file: `spec/lib/errors_spec.rb`
   - Coverage: All custom exception classes and their behavior

3. **lib/integrations/base.rb**
   - Test file: `spec/lib/integrations/base_spec.rb`
   - Coverage: HTTP response handling, error conversion, configuration validation

4. **lib/services/task_service.rb**

## Still Requiring Tests

### Components without test coverage:
1. **lib/integrations/webhook_handler_refactored.rb** - The refactored version needs its own tests
2. **server_refactored.rb** - The main application file needs integration tests
3. **lib/task_manager.rb** - Core business logic needs unit tests
4. **lib/task_intelligence.rb** - AI/ML logic needs unit tests
5. **lib/integrations/google_calendar.rb** - Integration needs unit tests

### Existing tests that may need updates:
- `spec/lib/integrations/webhook_handler_spec.rb` - Update to test refactored version
- `spec/claude_api_endpoints_spec.rb` - Update to test refactored server
- `spec/security_middleware_spec.rb` - May need updates for new auth structure

## Running the Tests

To run all tests for refactored components:
```bash
asdf exec bundle exec rspec spec/lib/app_config_spec.rb \
  spec/lib/errors_spec.rb \
  spec/lib/services/ \
  spec/lib/integrations/base_spec.rb \
  spec/lib/helpers/request_helpers_spec.rb
```

To run with coverage report:
```bash
COVERAGE=true asdf exec bundle exec rspec [test files]
```

## Next Steps

1. Create tests for remaining untested components
2. Update existing tests to work with refactored code
3. Add integration tests for the refactored server
4. Increase overall test coverage to at least 80%
